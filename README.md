`XFloats` exports two these two types: `XFloat16`, `XFloat32`.  Use them to compute results that are often more accurate nd still are obtained quickly.  These floating point types correspond to `Float16` and `Float32`.  The more accurate loating point type that corresponds to `Float64` is `Double64` from `DoubleFloats.jl`.  In both relative and absolute easure, `Double64` calculates much more slowly than `Float64`, but more quickly than `Float128` from `Quadmath.jl`.
