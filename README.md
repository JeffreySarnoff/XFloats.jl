`XFloats` exports two these two types: `XFloat16`, `XFloat32`.  Use them to compute results that are often more accurate
and still are obtained quickly.  These floating point types correspond to `Float16` and `Float32`.  The more accurate
floating point type that corresponds to `Float64` is `Double64` from `DoubleFloats.jl`.  In both relative and absolute
measure, `Double64` calculates much more slowly than `Float64`, but more quickly than `Float128` from `Quadmath.jl`.

##### _ XFloat are floating point values o_e___X__traccurate

(a) an `XFloat` is a specialized type for precision enhanced floating point values
    These `eXraaccurateFloat`
    - `XFloat16` stores, carries, applies, recieves and retrieves 16 bit floating point values
    - `XFloat32` stores, carries, applies, recieves and retrieves 32 bit floating point values
    
(b) an `XFloat` travels when stored in an xkit

is stored for travel in an xkit) kind of floating point there are two
-- values of type `XFloat16` or of type `XFloat32`
- `XFloats` perform arithemtic just as fast as do the corresponding system floating point types.
the systare just as fast the system floats 
`XFloats` come in two sizes: 16-bit and 32-bit.  There is no 64-bit XFloat type.There are two XFloat Types: `XFloat16` and `XFloat32`
XFloats compute at greater precision than Floats (more significant bits) more accurate, very fast 
Precision-doubled floating point types almost as fast as the system floats Float32, Float64,.
