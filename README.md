#### `FastRationals`

(a) an `XFloat` is a specialized type for precision enhanced floating point values
    - `XFloat16s` are used to store and to retrieve 16 bit floating point values
    - `XFloat32s` are used to store and to retrieve 32 bit floating point values
    
(b) an `XFloat` travels when stored in an xkit

is stored for travel in an xkit) kind of floating point there are two
-- values of type `XFloat16` or of type `XFloat32`
- `XFloats` perform arithemtic just as fast as do the corresponding system floating point types.
the systare just as fast the system floats 
`XFloats` come in two sizes: 16-bit and 32-bit.  There is no 64-bit XFloat type.There are two XFloat Types: `XFloat16` and `XFloat32`
XFloats compute at greater precision than Floats (more significant bits) more accurate, very fast 
Precision-doubled floating point types almost as fast as the system floats Float32, Float64,.
for high-performance with 99% of the performace of hardware floats.
